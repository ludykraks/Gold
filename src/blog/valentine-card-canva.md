<p>Valentine's day is a couple of days away, I don't know all your plans on that day, but
        if you plan on sending an ecard to your loved one, then you are at the right place.
      </p>
      <p>I will show you how to design a beautiful personalised Val's day card and send
        it to your lover on Whatsapp, Facebook or Instagram.</p>
      <h2>What you will need:</h2>
      <p>You won't need any design experience to do this, it's an easy process,
        just tag along. It would only take some few minutes.</p>
      <p>First, you will need to <a href="https://www.canva.com">download Canva app</a> (it's free)
        onto your iPhone or android. Canva is a drag-and-drop tool you can use to design
        beautiful graphics. You can use Canva on your PC as well.</p>
      <p>After you download the app, open it and sign up to begin designing.
        On the homepage, you will see different templates, from Instagram Posts to Invitation Cards.
        You may try them later.</p>
      <p>But for now:</p>
      <p>Type <em>Valentine</em> into the search box above. You should see different design templates below.
        Glance through and pick one.</p>
      <p>After selecting one, the template will be displayed on your screen for you to edit.
         You may edit it as much you like.</p>
      <p>Click on a text on the template to edit it to your own words.</p>

  <p>You can replace or add your own pictures, texts or objects to the template.
         To do that, click on the add (+) button at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <p>After you are done editing the card to your liking, go to the share button at the top right corner
         and share it with you loved one.</p>
      <p>Below is a special card we designed for you:</p>
