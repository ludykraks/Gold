<p>Mobile money interoperability is finally here. The Ghana Interbank Payment
         and Settlement Systems (GhIPSS) has at long last completed the system
         that ensures cross-network mobile money transactions.</p>
      <h2>What is mobile money interoperability?</h2>
      <p>It is a system that allows customers to transfer money between two mobile
        money accounts belonging to different mobile money operators or between
        a mobile money account and a bank account.</p>
      <p><strong>This simply means that:</strong></p>
      <p>Mobile money subscribers in Ghana can now easily transfer money from their current network operator to
        any other network operator (<em>excluding Glo Ghana</em>).</p>
      <p><strong>No need to download any app or visit any agent. Send/receive money directly</strong></p>
      <p>In Practice: if you use MTN Mobile Money, you can send money to and
        receive money from any other network, be it Vodafone Cash or AirtelTigo Money.</p>
      <p><strong>For example:</strong></p>
      <h2>Transfer money from MTN Mobile Money account to Vodafone Cash account</h2>
      <p>1. Dial MTN Mobile Money short code: *170# </p>
      <p>2. Select <em>Transfer Money</em></p>
      <p>3. Choose <em>Other Networks</em></p>
      <p>4. Select the Network <em>e.g. Vodafone</em></p>
      <p>5. Enter the person's phone number, confirm number</p>
      <p>6. Type the Amount</p>
      <p>7. Enter Reference</p>
      <p>8. And enter your PIN</p>
      <p>That's it, mobile money transfer transaction is completed. Easy as cake.</p>

  <h2>Send Money from Vodafone to MTN or AirtelTigo </h2>
      <p>Dial Vodafone Cash short code *110#, choose <em>Send Money</em>, select <em>Other Networks</em>, 
       choose the network operator and follow prompts. </p>
      <h2>Send Money from AirtelTigo to MTN or Vodafone </h2>
      <p>Dial AirtelTigo Money short code *110#, choose <em>Send Money/Cash</em>, select <em>To Mobile Number</em>, choose <em>Other 
        Networks</em> and follow prompts. </p>

  <h2>How to Transfer Credit from MTN to Vodafone</h2>
      <p>To do this, you have to first transfer money from MTN to Vodafone and 
       then use the money received in the Vodafone wallet to buy airtime.</p>   
      <p>If you never liked mobile money in the past, it's now more important to
        start using mobile money because of its interoperability.</p>
        
  <p>Note: Various charges apply. <br> For MTN users: Should you see 'msisdn' prompt 
      on your screen it's simply asking for a mobile phone number.</p>
