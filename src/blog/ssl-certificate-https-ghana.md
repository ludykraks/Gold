  <p>Did you just open your website in Chrome to find out it has been marked
        as <span style="color:red">"not secure"</span>?</p>
      <p>You probably saw this message below:</p>
      <blockquote> <em>Your connection to this site is not secure<br> You should not enter
        any sensitive information on this site (for example, passwords or credit
        cards), because it could be stolen by attackers.</em></blockquote>
      <p>Well it is true, your website is not secure.
        <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/milestone-chrome-security-marking-http-not-secure/">Google
         has been warning</a> website owners about securing their websites for quite some time now.</p>
      <p>If you haven't, you should. Immediately.</p>
      <p>Not only is it critical to you as a website owner to get your website
        secured, it is equally important for your users.</p>
      <h2>Why should I get my website secured (migrate from http to https)?</h2>
      <p>For starters, the "not secure" symbol Google shows to users who visit your site is
        nothing to write home about.</p>
      <p>The warning removes trust users may have in your website.
        Internet users share a lot of personal information when they visit your
        site. Some of these information include emails, phone numbers, passwords,
        usernames, bank account details etc.</p>
      <p>You don't want customers (old and potential) to have second thoughts about visiting your
        website to take an action such as buying a product or signing up for a newsletter etc
        because of the absence of HTTPS on your site.</p>
      <p>You can avoid all these <em>security and trust issues</em> by getting an SSL
        certificate installed on your website.</p>
      <h2>What is SSL certificate?</h2>
      <p>SSL certificate is an encryption technology that secures the connection
        between users' browser and websites.</p>
      <p>This prevents third parties from coming in between your connection and
         stealing your users personal information.</p>
      <p>The presence of <strong>https</strong> preceding your web address indicates a secured website.</p>
      <h2>How do I get SSL certificate in Ghana?</h2>
      <p>You can get your website secured with an SSL certificate by:<p>
      <p>1. Doing it yourself. If you have access to your website's hosting
        dashboard/cPanel, you can check if your web host gives you access to
        install a Let's Encrypt Free SSL certificate.</p>
