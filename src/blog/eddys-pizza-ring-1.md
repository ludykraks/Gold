<p>Eddys Pizza has over the years, as we all know, become synonymous with pizza in
      Ghana.</p>
      <p>And in their quest to remain more dominant in providing quality
      food service in Ghana, Eddys Pizza officially launched its newest branch
      at Ring Road on 17th August, 2019.</p>
      <h2>Where can I find the new Ring Road branch?</h2>
      <p>This new branch is actually a relocation of the old one and the
      convenient thing about this is that it's just 2 buildings away
      from the old one, opposite Paloma Hotel.</p>
      <p>Old customers will therefore have little to no troubles finding this new
       brightly-coloured ultra-modern building.</p> 
      <h2>The Grand Opening</h2>
      <p>Beginning with dazzling fireworks, the new Ring Road branch was officially 
       opened to the public.</p>

      customers and took them for the vanishing.</p>
      <p>Dance influencer and sensation Lloyd and the DWP dance crew also excited the

      <p>The younger audience at the event couldn't help but move their bodies in rhythm to the dance moves by the dancers.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the launch of the Ring Road branch, the CEO, Mr Edwin Quartey said, 
      <em>"We started about nine years ago. We were living in the USA and we were like we need 
      to come back home and do something. So, yes we started with Eddys Pizza."</em></p>
