title: "Will Shatta Wale's Album Reign After Sarkodie's Advice"

---

   <p>If you haven't heard Sarkodie's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDxGBCQF_iY">My Advice freestyle</a> aimed at
      Shatta Wale (and other local artistes), then you must be hiding under a rock.</p>

<p>Sarkodie's recent diss/advice track to Shatta Wale
      has been trending for some days now. The now popular track has so far garnered
      over 400,000 views on YouTube and got over 100k tweets on Twitter.</p>

<p>Sarkodie's <em>My Advice</em> track soon after being released received highly favourable reviews,
      with several fellow celebrities in Ghana giving Sarkodie's freestyle their thumb of approval.</p>

  <p>The track was so well-receieved that Pope Skinny, a high ranking member of the
      Shatta Movement couldn't stay quiet but openly show his appreciation of
      Sarkodie's rap skills on social media.</p>

  <p>To many, this was a track that was needed.</p>

  <p>Sarkodie has proven over and over again that he's one of the best rappers on the continent.
      His advice to Shatta Wale was straight to the point even though he occasionally mocked
      Shatta Wale claiming that Shatta wears alumi chains.</p>


<h2>Shatta Wale's Reign album</h2>

  <p>Shatta Wale has been promoting his upcoming Reign about for sometime now and
      part of his sales gimmicks has included taunting some of his industry mates like
      Samini, Stonebwoy, and Sarkodie.</p>

  <p>Samini and Stonebwoy are already used to Shatta Wale's lyrical and verbal attacks
      and they similarly trade lyrical shots with him. The audience, however have somehow
      grown tired of their ongoing back and forth shots.</p>

  <p><strong>Sark and Shatta</strong></p>

  <p>What's new is shots between Sark and Shatta.</p>

  <p>One wouldn't believe that there would ever be bad blood between Shatta Wale and Sarkodie.</p>
  <p>The two artistes have been the industry leaders and have been fighting for their fellow
      artistes to be respected and be paid well.</p>

  <p>How they have gone about that has been different. While Sarkodie has been more diplomatic
      with his campaign, Shatta Wale has done the opposite, he has vociferously attacked key players
      in the industry in order to get things changed.</p>

  <p>Controversy is nothing new to Shatta Wale, it's been his blessing albeit causing him
      troubles on a  number of occasions. Shatta Wale sees nothing wrong with it, to him it's SHOWBIZ, it's all
      part of the game. He became popular for the second time in Ghana because of this and has built a
      strong fanbase he calls Shatta Movement based off of that, his tenacity and his charisma.</p>
      <p>Whether Sarkodie advice will shake his fanbase is still a something we are yet to see.
      Like they say Shatta Movement For Life.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless we await to hear his Reign album, which will be launched today at the Fantasy Dome.
      Will the Reign album be successful? Has Sarkodie finally put Shatta Wale to sleep with the release of his timely
      My Advice freestyle few days before Shatta's album? Will Shatta come out with a roar like a lion or with a bleep of a sheep?</p>

  <p>We will find out in the next couple of days.</p>
