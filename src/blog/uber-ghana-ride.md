      <h2>Uber Ghana Introduces Connect</h2>
      <p>Uber Ghana has introduced a new feature to its app known as Connect. 
       With Uber Connect, users can now send items to be delivered to their friends and family.</p>
      <p>To use this feature, open your app, tap on the Connect button and choose the locations to order your ride.</p>
      <h3>Which items can you send?</h3>
      <p>According to Uber Ghana, packages must total less than the equivalent of GHc 280.00 in value, 
      be less than 15 kg, and fit comfortably in the trunk of a midsize 
      vehicle or topbox of a bike.</p> 
      <p>Banned items include letters, alcohol, medication, and dangerous or illegal items. 
      Uber does not maintain insurance coverage for package loss, damage, or theft.</p>
      <h2>Is Uber in Ghana?</h2>
      <p>Yes, Uber started <a href="http://citifmonline.com/2016/06/08/uber-commences-operations-in-ghana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">operations 
      in Ghana in 2016</a>, and if you haven't had your
        first ride yet, don't worry, it's not too late to enjoy your first.</p>
      <p>Uber is fully operational in both Accra, Tema and Kumasi.</p>
      <p>After reading this, you will get pretty familiar with the Uber Ghana app.</p>
      <h2>What is Uber?</h2>
      <p>You most likely know what it is, but to those who don't know:</p>
      <p>To passengers, Uber is like our taxis but instead of going to the roadside
        to hail one, you can comfortably be at home, office or wherever you are and use
        your smartphone to request a car directly to your doorstep. Yeah, basically.</p>
      <blockquote>You tap a button on your Uber Ghana app, you get a ride
        within minutes.</blockquote>
      <p>Uber Ghana currently works in <strong>Accra</strong>, <strong>Tema</strong>, <strong>Takoradi</strong>  and <strong>Kumasi.</strong></p>

  <h2>Sounds cool, right? Get your first Uber Ghana ride</h2>
      <p>First, you have to download the Uber Ghana app:</p>
      <ul>
       <li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubercab&hl=en">Uber App (Android)</a></li>
       <li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gh/app/uber/id368677368?mt=8">Uber App (iOS)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>After downloading the app, allow Uber to access your location and
        sign up using your phone number, Facebook or Google account.</p>
      <p>Your first ride is waiting, make a request.</p>
      <p>On your screen, you will see a map and a search box above asking you "<strong>Where to?</strong>"
        Enter where you want to go to <em>(Uber will give you suggestions,
        choose the one most appropriate to your destination or set one on the map)</em>.</p>
      <p>Uber will show you the available cars closest to you and give you an
        estimate of the time it will take for a driver to arrive and the price in Ghana Cedis.</p>
      <p>If you are okay with the fare, tap on <em>Confirm UberX</em> to request the ride.</p>
      <p>Wait a few seconds for the driver to accept and contact you to get your exact location.</p>
      <p>You will see the driver's picture, car details and the number of minutes
         it will take the driver to get to your place.</p>
      <p>Wait for the driver to arrive to enjoy your first Uber Ghana ride.</p>
      <blockquote>Don't forget to wear your seat belt</blockquote>
      <h2>Payment Method</h2>
      <p>Uber Ghana accepts:</p>
      <p>Cash and <br> Debit/Credit Card <br>
        <a href="what-is-mtn-momo">Uber Cash</a>. You can now make payments using MTN MoMo, Vodafone Cash or AirtelTigo Money. </p>
      <p>Cash payment: When you arrive at your destination, the driver will confirm the fare and you pay.</p>

      <h2>Uber Ghana Promo Codes & Free Rides</h2>

      <p>You can get free rides by inviting your friends.
       Just go to the menu icon and invite your friends via SMS, WhatsApp, Facebook etc.  </p>
      <p>Once they sign up, they will get their first ride free, and
       you will also get your next ride for free.</p>
      <h2>Things you Should Know [Uber Ghana Tips]</h2>
      <p>Should you lose an item in an Uber taxi, get involved in an accident or have an issue with a driver,
      just click on the menu icon, go to <em>Your Trips</em>, tap on that particular trip and make a report.</p>
      <p>Fares change due to demand, when the demand is very high, it can be quite
       expensive using Uber Ghana. For example, prices can be high on Sunday mornings when many
       people are requesting for Uber rides to church.</p>  
      <p>Uber Ghana doesn't charges you for cancelling a request.</p>
      <p>You can easily save a location: just tap <em>Where To?</em>, click on Save Places to add a place.</p>
      <p>When you are at a mall e.g. Accra Mall and you are ordering a ride, it's usually cheaper to type the name of 
      the mall than to just order your ride using the <em>current location</em> option.</p>
      <p>Before you get into any Uber car, make sure the car number and colour matches what you see on your app.</p>
      <p>When you get into your Uber car, make sure the driver starts the trip on his/her app.</p>
      <p>Wishing you a smooth ride. Let us know how your first Uber trip went.</p>
