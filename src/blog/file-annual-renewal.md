  <p>Did you recently receive a message from the Registrar General Department (RGD) that read:</p>
      <blockquote><em>Your records indicate that you have not filed your Annual Renewal.
        Please do so before 30 April 20XX or you will be deemed not in good standing </em></blockquote>
      <p>If you did, it means that you haven't renewed your business or filed your annual returns.</p>
      <p><strong>So what do you do now?</strong></p>
      <p>You can renew it <a href="https://www.ghana.gov.gh/rgd/annual-renewal/"  rel="noopener">online</a> like the 
      <a href="nhis-ghana-shortcode-renew">NHIS Renewal</a>, fortunately the Registrar General 
      Department has gone online with this. Regardless of where you are, visit the Ghana.gov website and create an account to begin.</p>
      <h2>How do you renew your business registration offline?</h2>
      <p>Before you head to the RGD office to begin the process, you will need</p> 
      <ul> 
       <li>Previous year's renewal receipt</li>
       <li>Cash, not loads but nothing less than Ghc 50.00</li>
      </ul>
      <p>1. First, you need to buy the form at the RGD office. <em>You may also download the form online and print it.</em>
      <br>Form for Sole Proprietorship/Venture/Enterprise costs just GHc 1.00 and...
      <br>Form for Annual Return of a Company costs GHc 3.50</p>
      <p>2. Fill the form, and move to the Annual Renewals till <em>(You may need to get a 
       ticket or join a queue)</em> to find out the total amount you have to pay to 
       be in good standing. You will pay more if you failed to pay in previous years</p>
      <p>3. A printed A4 sheet showing the total amount will be given to you. Now head back
        to the payment till (currently Fidelity Bank) to make the final payment</p>
      <p>That's it, you are done.</p>
      <h2>How much will I pay to renew my business for the current year?</h2>
      <p>It costs Ghc 25.00 to pay for the current year (Sole Proprietorship/Enterprise/Venture).</p>
      <p>Note: It's advisable to file your annual renewal at the beginning of the year so 
       you avoid the huge traffic and inconvenience at the RGD office during the last days of April.</p>
      <p>And do so annually to avoid trouble.<p>
