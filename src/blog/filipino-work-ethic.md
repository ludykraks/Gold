<p>According to some estimates, 10.2 million people from the Philippines or
        of Filipino descent are working abroad. Filipinos work in more than 100
        different countries, one of the largest diaspora populations globally.
        No matter where they work, Filipinos the world over have a reputation
        for being excellent employees and team members.
      </p>
      <p>This gold-standard reputation can be directly attributed to strong Filipino
        values and a stellar work ethic.  There are a number of key elements that
        help us understand how the Filipino community has earned such a positive
        and well-deserved reputation. Whether working in the Philippines or abroad,
        here are the values that make Filipinos a level above other employees.</p>
      <h2>Highly Educated</h2>
      <p>Education is a major part of Filipino culture, especially for those who
        have migrated to other countries. In the US, Filipinos, when compared to
        other immigrant groups as well as US born citizens, have an <a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/filipino-immigrants-united-states">above average
        education</a> rate. They also have an extremely high English speaking
        proficiency, ranking as the second highest in Asia and 14th highest in
        the world. Both factors contribute greatly to Filipino success in the workforce.</p>
      <h2>Hospitality & Generosity</h2>
      <p>Instilled into their culture, Filipino workers will make you feel welcome,
        even if they haven’t known you for a long time. They will immediately
        ask you to join them for a meal or drink after work and will offer to
        show you around their city or town.  They are naturally inclusive and
        will ensure that you meet their office mates so you’ll quickly feel part
        of the team. You’ll rarely find a Filipino worker that refuses to mingle
        with others, and as any manager knows, building a strong rapport amongst
        teammates is paramount to managing a successful team.</p>
      <p>Filipino workers make up a substantial percentage of the international
        workforce in the healthcare industry. Given the values and ethics that
        are known to be such an integral part of Filipino culture, it’s no surprise
        that Filipino workers are drawn to this career path, becoming highly
        sought-after employees across the private and public healthcare sector.</p>
      <h2>Family Values</h2>
      <p>When dealing with your staff in the Philippines and abroad, you will more
        than likely see their strong commitment to their families. <a href="https://diversifyoss.com/newsroom/understanding-filipino-work-culture/" rel="noopener nofollow">Values of
        respect, hard work and loyalty</a> are heavily influenced by their personal
        relationships with their families and these carry over to their professional
        lives as well.</p>
      <p>Filipinos are responsible, dependable and hardworking;
        this can be directly attributed to the culturally-rooted trait of filial
        obligation (taking care of the sick family members, sending money to help
        pay for education of family members and miscellaneous family needs). The
        importance of “family values” translates into the workplace as well,
        with Filipino’s demonstrating a strong commitment to their team and
        team members, treating them as an extension of their families.</p>
      <h2>“Hiya” and “Mahiyain”</h2>
      <p>The concept of pride or “saving face” is a big deal in Asian work cultures.
        It is often associated with Japanese workspaces, but it can also be applied
        in the Philippine setting. Often, Filipinos are not very confrontational
        and value their reputation. They go out of their way to avoid losing face
        or being embarrassed in public settings. Being “hiya” or “mahiyain” is a
        complicated Filipino value that puts importance on how others see you,
        therefore influencing their behavior in a workplace environment. In an
        age where accountability is a lost art, “Hiya” instills a refreshing
        sense of pride in Filipino workers.</p>
      <h2>The value of hard work</h2>
      <p>Working overtime is a popular concept in the Filipino work culture.
        Many workers don’t mind working after business hours because they know
        it can help add value to the work they do.  Despite having their own
        heavy workload, Filipinos will offer assistance to their colleagues in
        order to help the team as a whole. Furthermore, it is a common statement
        from foreign employers that the <a href="https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1032498" rel="noopener nofollow">work ethics and dedication of overseas
        Filipino workers (OFWs)</a> are top notch and unmatched. In countries such
        as Kuwait and the US, employers can attest to this as hiring rates for
        Filipinos is growing.</p>
      <p>It’s clear that Filipino workers have carved out a unique place in the
        international market as high performing, highly sought after employees.
        Their strong moral code, along with family values and ethical workplace
        practices has solidified their place as trustworthy and hard working employees.</p>
      <p>As more and more Filipinos travel and work abroad, this reputation continues.
        to spread, as the rest of the world embraces the quality that Filipino employees bring</p>
