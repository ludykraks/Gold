  <p>Vodafone/Telecel Ghana has finally rolled out it's 4G network to its users, 
       days earlier than we anticipated.</p>
      <p>This thus makes Vodafone/Telecel the second telecommunication company 
       in Ghana to offer 4G mobile service to its customers, after <a href= "mtn-4g-plus"> MTN Ghana rolled out its 4G</a> in 2016.</p>
      <p>Let's get started...</p>
      <h2>Do I need a new sim card to use Vodafone's 4G network?</h2>

       whether you have enabled the 4G network settings.</p>
