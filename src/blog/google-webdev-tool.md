---

<p>Google has introduced a new modern web performance tool
      <a href="https://web.dev">web.dev</a>. This new website will be
      good for all web developers who want to improve upon thier
      clients' websites and apps. Web.dev has different learning materials on:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>Fast Load Times</li>
       <li>Network Resilience</li>
       <li>Web Security</li>
       <li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
       <li>Progressive Web Apps and </li>
       <li>Accessibility</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition to the learning materials, you get to
       test your website/app on the above important metrics of the web.</p>
      <p>Web.dev measures your performance on a score scale. Getting
        a score between 90 to 100 means that your site is doing great and will
        need little to no improvement. However, getting a score of less than 50 on
        a particular metric means that your website/app performed
        poorly and will therefore need a lot of improvement.</p>
