<p>One of the first questions that comes to mind when planning on getting 
        your first website is: <em>"How much is the cost of a website in Ghana?"</em></p>
      <p>If you happen to know a web developer, then you are just a phone call away from knowing the cost. 
       If you don't know anyone in the web space then you probably turn to Google to get that question answered.</p>
      <p>If that's the question you're currently asking, you're at the right place.
        This article seeks to guide you to know the cost of a website in Ghana.</p>
      <blockquote><em>Like a friend of mine will say, "Ɛyɛ sika asɛm."</em></blockquote>
      <p>Let's address the question then ... :</p>
      <h2>How much does it cost to develop a website in Ghana?</h2>
      <p>You are not going to like my next two words: </p>
      <p><strong>"It depends."</strong></p>
      <p>But... hold on a minute. The good news is: the price of a website in Ghana is affordable.
        Before I break it down for you, know that the cost of a website in Ghana
        could be anywhere between GH₵ 800 and GH₵ 3000 a year. </p>
      <p><em>Skip <a href="#web-prices">to prices of websites in Ghana</a> (table)</em>.</p>
      <p>Yes, it depends on the kind of website you desire to get built and the kind of web
        applications you want on your website.</p>
      <p>This article seeks to address the cost of websites for service organisations such as
        hotels, restaurants, gyms, clinics, NGOs, personal blogs etc.
      <p>And product businesses like boutiques, pharmacies, beauty shops etc.</p>
      <p>The article <em>will not address</em> the cost of more sophisticated websites
        like social media, betting or music streaming platforms. These sites are quite
        complex, takes time to build and are therefore more expensive.</p>
      <p>Below are factors that will determine how much you pay for a well functioning website:</p>
      <h2>Domain Name Registration</h2>
      <p>Coming up with and registering a domain name are the first steps you take
       in having your website online. A domain name is your website's name. Users
       will use your domain name to land on your website.</p>
      <p>Most often, you register your brand name or a name closely related to your brand.
       There are several domain registrars where you can check whether the domain
       name you plan on using is available or already taken. If you check and it's available, 
       you register that name immediately.</p>
      <p>Because most single-word brand names have already been registered, the alternative addition of <em>gh</em> to
         your brand name is encouraged when registering your new domain name.</p>
      <p>You may also choose a domain name that ends with <em>.com.gh.</em></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.godaddy.com" target="_blank">GoDaddy</a> and
         <a href="https://www.namecheap.com" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>
        are registrars where you can easily purchase your domain name.
        Registering a domain name that ends with a <em>.com or .org</em> should cost you
        between GH₵ 60 and GH₵ 90 per year, .com.gh however costs more.</p>
      <p>You can personally purchase your domain name on any of the above sites or let
        a <a href="5-top-web-agencies-ghana">web agency in Ghana</a> take care of it for you.</p>
      <p>There are other local Ghanaian companies like Nacrotek and WopeDigital who can register a domain name for you.</p>
      <p>Note: Both GoDaddy and Namecheap offer discounts when you register your
        domain name for 3 years or more. Make sure you take advantage of such discounts during checkout.</p>
      <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
      <p>Let's simply define a web host as a place where web files are stored. Your
       files are securely kept with a web host so that when a visitor wants to access your website, the web pages
       are served from the web host's servers.</p>
       <p>There are different hosting packages, and web hosting companies charge
       various fees for hosting your web files.</p>
       <p>If you plan on starting a personal blog or a website for your business, 
       then the price you pay for your website shouldn't be more than GH₵ 1000 a year.</p>
       <p>Most web hosting companies are flexible and will allow you to upgrade your hosting plan when you start
       getting more visitors to your website.</p>
      <p>This means that you can start with a simple plan that costs less and upgrade later.</p>
      <p>Getting a good web hosting service provider is very important. Be careful of <em>free or very cheap</em>
        hosting packages as they are mostly neither reliable nor secure. If you
        want a good one, you should be willing to pay at least GH₵ 400 per year.</p>
      <p>Before you decide on the web hosting to choose, make sure that you read online 
       reviews to find out if they are credible. Do not also compromise on speed 
       and customer care service when you are choosing your hosting partner as these 
       factors can make or break the success of your website.</p>
      <h2>Designing and Development of the Website</h2>
      <p><a href="know-web-design-companies-ghana">Web design companies</a> will have to design and develop websites that suit your
        desires.</p>
      <p>It takes skills and time to come up with design ideas. And a designer/developer will
        have to code and/or use paid-for software to turn those ideas into a beautiful and functional website.</p>
      <p>Often, clients may change their minds on the design and features they want
        on their websites, and web agencies would have to listen and develop the website
        according to their clients' preferences.</p>
      <p>Web agencies therefore charge for designing and building websites. In
        Ghana, some may charge as low as GH₵ 300 or a high as GH₵ 1000 for the development process.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3032719/ui-ux-who-does-what-a-designers-guide-to-the-tech-industry" rel="noopener nofollow">User 
       experience (UX) and User interface (UI)</a> are very important when it comes developing a website.</p>
      <h2>Web Maintenance</h2>
      <p>The role played by web agencies in web maintenance entails adding content
        (pictures, articles, products etc), updating software and plugins, adding new pages and
        monitoring your websites for security issues.</p>
      <p>In addition, web design and development companies offer web support services.</p>
      <p>While some web agencies may provide you with basic web maintenance and support services <em>for free</em>,
        others add premium services <em>(e.g 24/7 call support service and daily backups
        of your website)</em> at a price. This could cost you GH₵ 500.</p>
