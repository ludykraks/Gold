  <p>If you haven't updated your Google Chrome browser app in a long while on your
        android, iPhone or desktop computer, you need to do so now.</p>
  <p>To those who hate intrusive ads (we all do), here is the good news:
       Google announced that starting today, <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/chrome/browser-web-worth-protecting/">it will 
       stop showing annoying ads.</a></p>
 <p>Chrome now has a built-in ad blocker that will block
      <em>pop-up ads, auto-play video ads with sound, flashing animated ads, large sticky ads etc.</em></p>
  <p>Below are the kinds of ads Chrome will be blocking on both desktop and mobile devices:</p>

     <p>Chrome will block these ads by default so they don't
      intrude your web browsing experience.</p>
     <p>You will see a notification when Chrome blocks ads, and can choose to view them if you want to.</p>
     <p>Note: Chrome will still show non-intrusive, not so annoying ads.</p>
