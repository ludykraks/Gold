      <p>It was very worrying last year when several reports were made in the media of the <a href="https://www.myjoyonline.com/business/2017/October-23rd/staff-of-telcos-accomplices-in-mobile-money-fraud-police.php"> prevalence of MTN Mobile Money fraud</a> across the country.</p> <p> MTN Ghana calmed down our fears when they quickly issued a statement stating that such reports were highly exaggerated.</p>
      <p>But as long as fraudsters see an opportunity to scam or "mugu" people, they will always
         try to. You can avoid being defrauded by being a little bit vigilant.</p>

 <p>Below are 8 ways you can stay safe when using MTN mobile money.</p>

<h2>1. Never give your MTN mobile money PIN to anyone</h2>
      <p>It is highly advised to never share your PIN (secret number) with anyone
         and this includes mobile money agents, workers of MTN and your friends.</p>
      <p>Mobile money agents and MTN workers are not to ask you for your PIN to
         initiate any transaction on your behalf. Your PIN is your secret number.</p>

<blockquote>Don't fall for MoMo Scam</blockquote>

<h2>2. Make you PIN harder for people to guess</h2>
      <p>Just like you do whenever you choose a password for a new email,
         you should make sure that your PIN is difficult to guess.</p>
      <p>When choosing your 4 numbers, it's best to avoid using the
         year of your birth, the day and month of birth, repetitive numbers
         like 1111, 2222 etc. Also avoid common pattern numbers like 1234 or 2018.</p>
      <p>Use a PIN that would be difficult for people to guess, but easy to remember.
         If you currently have a weak PIN, you can change it. Dial the MTN mobile
         money shortcode <em>*170#</em>, select <em>Wallet</em> and choose
         <em>Change MM PIN</em> to set a new PIN.</p>

<h2>3. Don't give your phone to mobile money agents</h2>
      <p>You shouldn't give your mobile phone to agents to do a transaction on your behalf.</p>
      <p>If you give your phone to an agent to initiate a transaction on your behalf, you expose
         yourself to being defrauded.</p>

<h2>4. Wait for confirmation</h2>
     <p>Whenever you make a deposit at any MTN mobile money merchant shop, make sure
       you receive confirmation text before you
       leave. Make sure the text received is <em>from MobileMoney.</em> </p>
     <p>Be vigilant and watch out for text messages from suspicious phone numbers.
        Always verify transaction details before withdrawing or transferring money.</p>

<h2>5. Count money in front of agent</h2>
     <p>Always count money withdrawn right in front of agent to make sure it is the
        exact amount before leaving the place of transaction.</p>

<h2>6. Beware of fraudulent text messages and calls</h2>
    <p>MTN sends mobile money text/info via the name <strong>MobileMoney.</strong>
       Don't trust text messages from suspicious phone numbers regarding your mobile money account.
       Treat such numbers with suspicion and don't follow instructions they ask.</p>
    <p>Beware of scam calls asking you to send MTN mobile money to their accounts to receive
       cash prizes or asking for your account details.</p>
    <p>Whenever in doubt, don't hesitate to call MTN customer service number 100.</p>

<h2>7. Don't click on suspicious links in emails</h2>
    <p>Avoid clicking on links in emails or texts that look suspicious. Don't send details
      of your mobile money account via texts or unencrypted emails. Immediately
      <a href="https://www.mtn.com.gh/personal/support/report-fraud">report suspicious emails to
      MTN Ghana</a> or your bank.</p>

<h2>8. Report any suspicion of a fraudulent person/agent or transaction immediately</h2>
    <p>You shouldnâ€™t wait too long to report any fraudulent activity. Call MTN on 100
       or visit their nearest Customer Service Centre to make the report.</p>

<p>Stay safe, and in the words of MTN Ghana, <em>"Don't be a MUGU."</em> </p>
