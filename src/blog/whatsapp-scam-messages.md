<p>When was the last time you received a message on WhatsApp that read,
        <em>"Click this link to receive free KFC coupons," or "Click this link below to get
        50 GB free internet data on Vodafone?"</em></p>
      <p>If you are  active on WhatsApp, then my guess is: recently.
        The truth is most of these "free" messages are scams and you will not get
        what they promise.</p>
      <h2>Scam messages</h2>
      <p>If you click on such links, at best you will waste your
        time and get served with unwanted adverts, at worst your personal details and passwords
        will be stolen.</p>
      <p>Below are examples of such scam messages:</p>

  <h3>What you should know</h3>
      <p>1. Carefully check the website address, most of these scam messages contain web addresses
        that look similar to web addresses of big brands. But they are different, always check the
        spelling of the domain name.
      </p>
      <p>2. Most big brands have secure websites that begin with <strong><em>"https"</em></strong>.
        The links in scam messages are usually not secure and do not have the <em>"s"</em> at the end of "https."
       The S stands for secure.</p>

  <h2>WhatsApp Charges and Colour Changes</h2>
      <p>You might have also received a message that read, <em>"If you don't click this
        link below, you will be charged for using WhatsApp" or "Your WhatsApp colour will
        change from green to red if you click the link below."</em></p>

  <p>Don't click on such links. WhatsApp is a free app.</p>
      <p>If ever in doubt, visit <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com">WhatsApp's official blog</a>,
        you will find all information you need to know about WhatsApp there.</p>

  <blockquote><em>Never click on those scam links and protect your friends by not forwarding those
          messages.</em></blockquote>
