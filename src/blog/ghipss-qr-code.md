  <p>In line with the digitisation of Ghana's economy, the vice president of 
      Ghana, Dr Bawumiah has launched a <a href="https://ghipss.net/ghqr-faqs" rel="noopener">Universal 
      QR Code payment system</a>.</p>
      <p>This payment system will further our drive towards a cashless economy and 
      also make payment in Ghana easier and more convenient.</p>
      <p><a href= "http://www.businessghana.com/site/news/business/209192/Veep-launches-Universal-QR-code" rel="noopener">Speaking at the launch</a>, Dr 
      Bawumiah explained that, 'When you go to the merchant with a 
      universal QR Code, as long as you have a bank account from any financial institution 
      or a mobile money account from a telco, you will be able to pay the merchant 
      regardless of which bank or telco has acquired the merchant or service provider instantly.'</p>
      <h2>What is a QR Payment System?</h2>
      <p>This is a contactless payment method where payment is performed by 
      scanning a QR code using a smartphone.</p>
      <p>This has come at a very apt time as health experts are advising people to make 
      less contact during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
      <h2>How will this universal QR Code work?</h2>
      <p>To use this QR code payment as a customer, you scan the QR code 
       displayed by the merchant (e.g restaurant, supermarket, hotel) 
       with your smartphone's camera to pay for their goods/services. You then enter the 
       amount you have to pay and finally submit.</p>
      <p>You may also dial a short code to make payment.</p>
      <h2>Will I pay for using the Ghana QR code?</h2>
      <p>No, you won't be charged any fee as a customer.</p>
      <h2>How to Register for Ghana QR Code (GHQR)?</h2>
      <p>Visit your payment services provider (e.g bank) to sign up.</p>

<h2>For Merchants</h2>
      <p>With this Universal QR code, a merchant can receive payments instantly from customers 
      with bank accounts, wallet accounts or card accounts from different banks
      and payment service providers across the country.</p>
