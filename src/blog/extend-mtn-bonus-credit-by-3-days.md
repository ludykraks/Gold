<h2>Extend MTN bonus for Only 1 Pesewa</h2>
      <p>MTN Ghana gives you 100% bonus credit every time you buy airtime using your mobile
       money, which is great except that it is only valid for <del>3</del> 7 days. But did you
       know you can top up with as little as 1 Ghana pesewa and get to extend your bonus credit by 7 days?</p>
      <blockquote><p>MTN bonus credit can be used for MTN to MTN calls and SMS</p></blockquote>
      <p>Assuming you have GH&#8373;20 worth of bonus credit that will be expiring
       today and you don't want to use all the bonus credit or top up with 1 Ghana Cedi
       or above, you can top up with 1 Ghana pesewa and get to extend your GH&#8373;20
       bonus credit by 7 more days. Follow these simple steps to do that.</p>
      <p>Do this using your <a href="what-is-mtn-momo">MTN Mobile Money</a>.</p>
      <p>Dial MTN Mobile Money shortcode *170#, select <em>Buy Airtime</em> and under <em>Enter Amount,</em> type 0.01</p>
      <p>Enter your mobile number and enter your PIN to confirm transaction.</p>
      <p>That's it, your bonus credit will be extended by 7 days. And it
         was for only 1 Ghana pesewa.</p>

           Mobile Money" class= "img-responsive center-block"> </p>
      <p>Make sure you top up again before the close of the 7th day or you will lose all
         your bonus credit. If you keep doing this every six days, your bonus
         credit will never expire. And that will cost you just some few pesewas.</p>
